/* Print 1-255
print1To255()
Print all the integers from 1 to 255. */



/* Print Ints and Sum 0-255
printIntsAndSum0To255()
Print integers from 0 to 255, and with each
integer print the sum so far. */



/* Print Max of Array
printMaxOfArray(arr)
Given an array, find and print its largest element. */



/* Return Odds Array 1-255
returnOddsArray1To255()
Create an array with all the odd integers between
1 and 255 (inclusive). */



/* Return Array Count Greater than Y
returnArrayCountGreaterThanY(arr, y)
Given an array and a value Y, count and print the
number of array values greater than Y. */



/* Print Max, Min, Average Array Values
printMaxMinAverageArrayVals(arr)
Given an array, print the max, min and average
values for that array. */



/* Swap String for Array Negative Values
swapStringForArrayNegativeVals(arr)
Given an array of numbers, replace any negative
values with the string 'Dojo'. */



/* Print Odds 1-255
printOdds1To255()
Print all odd integers from 1 to 255. */



/* Print Array Values
printArrayVals(arr)
Iterate through a given array, printing each value. */



/* Print Average of Array
printAverageOfArray(arr)
Analyze an array’s values and print the average. */



/* Square Array Values
squareArrayVals(arr)
Square each value in a given array, returning that
same array with changed values. */



/* Zero Out Array Negative Numbers
zeroOutArrayNegativeVals(arr)
Return the given array, after setting any negative
values to zero. */



/* Shift Array Values Left
shiftArrayValsLeft(arr)
Given an array, move all values forward (to the
left) by one index, dropping the first value and
leaving a 0 (zero) value at the end of the array. */

/* Min to Front

Given an array of comparable values, move the lowest element to array’s front, 
shifting backward any elements previously ahead of it. Do not otherwise change 
the array’s order. Given [4,2,1,3,5], change it to [1,4,2,3,5] and return it. 
As always, do this without using built-in functions.
*/



/* Concat

Given an array of comparable values, move the lowest element to array’s front, 
shifting backward any elements previously ahead of it. Do not otherwise change 
the array’s order. Given [4,2,1,3,5], change it to [1,4,2,3,5] and return it.
As always, do this without using built-in functions.
*/



/* Parens valid

Create a function that, given an input string str, returns a boolean whether parentheses in str are
valid. Valid sets of parentheses always open before they close, for example. For "Y(3(p)p(3)r)s",
return true. Given "N(0(p)3", return false: not every parenthesis is closed. Given "N(0)t )0(k",
return false, because the underlined ")" is premature: there is nothing open for it to close.
*/



/* String: Is Palindrome

Create a function that returns a boolean whether the string is a strict palindrome. For "a x a" or
"racecar", return true. Do not ignore spaces, punctuation and capitalization: if given "Dud" or
"oho!", return false.

# Outline for Wednesday Week 1 - January 11, 2023

## Reminders:
- Solo project proposal is due TONIGHT!
    - **Remember to email Justina, Thomas, Melissa and myself**
    - **Do NOT submit it to the platform until we have approved it!  Then after we approve it will you be allowed to submit!**
    - Make sure it has a wireframe (or some other visual mockup) and some sort of text file with the following:
        Name: 
        Stack: This will be Python, Java or JavaScript/MERN
        GitHub Repo:
        Wireframe: PDF or image (png, jpg, etc.) preferred
        Project Name: 
        Project Description:
        MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Features: 
        Bonus Features:
- Don't forget discussion topics!  Here are this week's:
    - https://login.codingdojo.com/d/97/53/1058 - "Welcome to the Projects & Algorithms portion of your program! Having completed projects to unveil to the public is a vital first step toward displaying your skill sets.  Take the time today to think about and mention 1. What website(s) you wish you could have help build/maintain. 2. What website(s) you might take ideas from to build your own projects and why, 3. Pick a CSS framework you want to explore this month."
    - https://login.codingdojo.com/d/97/53/1059 - "We're going to be hot and heavy into algorithm work alongside our projects.  We focus mostly on Arrays and Singly Linked Lists.  Explain the difference between a data TYPE and a data STRUCTURE in your own words, and list at least two other data structures besides Singly Linked Lists."
    - Due Sunday night at 10:59 PM Pacific!  If you encounter technical issues, send me screenshots of the problem AND your responses, both by the deadline!
- Fill out group project form!  Due Tuesday!  An email will be sent after today's lecture!
